# Solution Architecture

## Overview

It's often useful to create a solution architecture document to track what you plan to implement and how. Writing about what you're going to create is a great way to create clarity and identify design flaws early in the process.

By creating solution architecture documentation and diagrams, you are also able to capture the evolution of the project design.

## Diagram

Include a link to a diagram of your solution architecture. Can be created in any format that is preferred by the team (PowerPoint, Visio, Sketch, hand-drawn diagrams, etc.).
